        Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the rainforest, and to visit the
        volcano. However, there are other things to do, including visiting a local history museum,
        going on chartered fishing tours, snorkeling, zip-lining in the rainforest, visiting several
        pubs, including a microbrewery, dancing at a new dance club, seeing a movie, taking
        helicopter rides, playing at an arcade, visiting art galleries, and bowling. Also, a nine-hole
        golf course should be operational by next year. Many of these activities are located in Merriton
        Landing, which is a rapidly developing area on the north side of Yellow Leaf Bay.
        Most tourists spend most of their time in Taniti City, which boasts native architecture and nearby
        white, sandy beaches that encircle Yellow Leaf Bay. Other popular activities include boat or bus
        tours of the island, hikes in the rainforest, or visits to Taniti’s active volcano.
